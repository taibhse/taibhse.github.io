This is a simple blog hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
Using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to turn time Markdown content into a small beautiful static blog.
I followed [this](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) guide written by Barry Clark
The initial starting point was a fork of the example [jekyll-now](http://www.github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project
